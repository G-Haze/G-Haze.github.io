## IoC Skills Bootcamp Week 1 - Basic Pentesting

We kick things off with the [Basic Pentesting](https://tryhackme.com/room/basicpentestingjt) room on tryhackme to get some experience with brute forcing, hash cracking, service enumeration and Linux enumeration.

After setting up a Kali instance on VMware and connecting to the tryhackme network through OpenVPN we are ready to go 👍.

We begin by running nmap to discover which ports are currently open. No switches were required as the standard scan gave us the information we were looking for. 

```
$ nmap 10.10.139.208 
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-06 11:13 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.139.208
Host is up (0.031s latency).
Not shown: 994 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
8009/tcp open  ajp13
8080/tcp open  http-proxy

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.65 seconds
```
We can see from the nmap scan that port 80 http is open, this might mean there is a website that we are able to look at. 

![Website Snip 1](/docs/assets/basicPentestingSnip1.PNG)

We find out there is a web page being hosted on the target machine. Not much to go from but let's use the Web Developer Tools to check if there is any other information in the raw html that we can gather.

![Website Snip 2](/docs/assets/basicPentestingSnip2.PNG)

There is a comment that implies there are other sections of the website. We can use a web content enumeration tool such as DIRB or DirBuster to scan the site for any hidden folders or files.

```
$ dirb http://10.10.139.208

DIRB was able to find a listable directory named development. Let's check its contents in our web browser. 

![Website Snip 3](/docs/assets/basicPentestingSnip3.PNG)

There are two text notes that we can view. 

![Website Snip 4](/docs/assets/basicPentestingSnip4.PNG)

The first contains some information regarding the server and version number that they are running which may be useful to us. We can also note that Server Message Block has been set up and that there are two users referred to as "K" and "J".

![Website Snip 5](/docs/assets/basicPentestingSnip5.PNG)

The second note tells us that user "J" is using weak password credentials as their hash was able to be cracked "really easily". We can try enum4linux on our kali box to enumerate the system for more information.

```
$ enum4linux 10.10.139.208
