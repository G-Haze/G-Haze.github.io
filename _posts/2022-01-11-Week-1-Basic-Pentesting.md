## IoC Skills Bootcamp Week 1 - Basic Pentesting

We kick things off with the [Basic Pentesting](https://tryhackme.com/room/basicpentestingjt) room on tryhackme to get some experience with brute forcing, hash cracking, service enumeration and Linux enumeration.

After setting up a Kali instance on VMware and connecting to the tryhackme network through OpenVPN we are ready to go üëç.

We begin by running nmap to discover which ports are currently open. No switches were required as the standard scan gave us the information we were looking for. 

```
$ nmap 10.10.68.236 
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-06 11:13 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.68.236
Host is up (0.031s latency).
Not shown: 994 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
8009/tcp open  ajp13
8080/tcp open  http-proxy

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.65 seconds
```
We can see from the nmap scan that port 80 http is open, this might mean there is a website that we are able to look at.
