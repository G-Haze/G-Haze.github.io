## IoC Skills Bootcamp Week 3 - Security Operations and Incident Response

The purpose of this week was to introduce us to the work of a Security Operations Center (SOC) and the use of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. Often referred to as the “blue team”, the SOC is responsible for defending our systems and networks. They will proactively monitor activity, triage alerts against published threat reports, and will provide incident response in the case of a breach. Their role requires them to understand large volumes of activity data and contextualise these against the infrastructure they are protecting.

Splunk Enterprise is a powerful data analytics tool that has a wide range of applications across various industries. It is capable of aggregating machine data from multiple streams and feeding this into a graphical user interface for interpretation. The Splunk software makes the gathered data much easier to analyse and visualise through the use of Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) and the creation of customisable dashboards. For these reasons it is commonly used in SOCs to detect malicious network activity and respond to threats accordingly. 

We were given a TryHackMe room to work through on [Splunk](https://tryhackme.com/room/bpsplunk). The room uses datasets from the [Boss of the SoC](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/what-you-need-to-know-about-boss-of-the-soc.html) 2016 capture the flag event that were designed to emulate how real-life security incidents look like in Splunk. In the first scenario we had to identify an Advanced Persistent Threat within our network who had defaced our external website. This involved tracking down the IP addresses and domains used in the attack, the web scanner that the attacker used, how long it took them to brute-force the admin's credentials and the name and MD5 hash of the executuble uploaded by the attacker. 

The second scenario focused on discovering how a machine within our network had been infected with ransomware and the effects of it. This involved checking the windows registry logs for USB device entries, checking Sysmon logs to understand what processes were triggered by the infection, identifying suspicious domains visited and where the ransomware was downloaded from. The [Cerber](https://www.avast.com/c-cerber) ransomware was used in the attack, a malware first seen in 2016 that uses the ransomware as a service (RaaS) model for distribution, and for which there is no decryptor currently available.

During the week I also attended an online Splunk4Rookies workshop hosted by some Splunk Solution's Engineers. We were given access to our own instance of Splunk Enterprise so this was a fantastic opportunity to get some more hands on experience with the software. The aim of the workshop was to briefly show some of the capablities of Splunk and practice using SPL to search through and manipulate the data. I found the ability to quickly and efficiently draw pertient data from the dataset provided exceptionally useful and highlighted how important SIEM tools can be for incident response. Upon finishing the session I had set up my first ever dashboard for "Security Operations" that gave me a nice visual display of some basic indicators of malicious activity. 

This week gave me a fascinating insight into the work of a SOC analyst and the tools that I could expect to use in such a position. I understand that I have only scratched the surface of what Splunk is truly capable of, nevertheless, I hope with some more practice and daily use I will be on the way to becoming a Splunk Master.
