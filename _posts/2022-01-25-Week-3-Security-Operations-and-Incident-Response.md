## IoC Skills Bootcamp Week 3 - Security Operations and Incident Response

The purpose of this task was to introduce us to the work of a Security Operations Center (SOC), and the use of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. Often referred to as the “blue team”, the SOC is responsible for defending our systems and our networks. They will proactively monitor activity, triage alerts against published threat reports, and will provide incident response in the case of a breach. SOC analysts are in high demand as they need to be able to examine and understand large volumes of activity data, and contextualise these against the infrastructure they are protecting.

We were given a room TryHackMe room to complete based on [Splunk](https://tryhackme.com/room/bpsplunk), one of the most commonly used SIEM tools in the industry. In the scenario we had to identify an Advanced Persistent Threat within our network who had defaced our external website.
