## IoC Skills Bootcamp Week 3 - Security Operations and Incident Response

The purpose of this week was to introduce us to the work of a Security Operations Center (SOC) and the use of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. Often referred to as the “blue team”, the SOC is responsible for defending our systems and our networks. They will proactively monitor activity, triage alerts against published threat reports, and will provide incident response in the case of a breach. SOC analysts are in high demand as they need to be able to examine and understand large volumes of activity data, and contextualise these against the infrastructure they are protecting.

We were given a TryHackMe room to complete using [Splunk](https://tryhackme.com/room/bpsplunk), one of the most commonly used SIEM tools in the industry. In the scenario we had to identify an Advanced Persistent Threat within our network who had defaced our external website.

We were given a hands on experience with Splunk, a leading tool in the SIEM workspace. It can be used to aggregate and interrogate data and is a commonly used tool in SoCs (Security Operations Centers). We used datasets from the BoSS of the SoC (add link here) that provideed real world sceanrios for us to practice with. This gave us an insight into the working world of a SoC analyst and the tools that we could expect to use in such a position.

I found the ability to quickly and efficiently draw pertient data from the dataset provided was exceptionally useful and show cases how important ....
