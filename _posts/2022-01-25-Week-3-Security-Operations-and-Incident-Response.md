## IoC Skills Bootcamp Week 3 - Security Operations and Incident Response

The purpose of this week was to introduce us to the work of a Security Operations Center (SOC) and the use of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. Often referred to as the “blue team”, the SOC is responsible for defending our systems and our networks. They will proactively monitor activity, triage alerts against published threat reports, and will provide incident response in the case of a breach. Their role requires them to understand large volumes of activity data and contextualise these against the infrastructure they are protecting.

We were given a TryHackMe room to work through on [Splunk](https://tryhackme.com/room/bpsplunk), one of the most commonly used SIEM tools in the industry. In the first scenario we had to identify an Advanced Persistent Threat within our network who had defaced our external website. While the second scenario focused on discovering how a machine within the network had been infected with ransomware and the damage it had caused. The task used datasets from the [Boss of the SoC](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/what-you-need-to-know-about-boss-of-the-soc.html) that were designed to emulate how real security incidents look like in Splunk. 

Splunk Enterprise is a powerful data analytics tool that has a wide range of applications across various industries. It is capable of aggregating machine data from multiple streams and feeding this into a graphical user interface for interpretation. The Splunk software makes the gathered data much easier to analyse and visualise through the use of Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) and the creation of customisable dashboards. For these reasons it is commonly used in SOCs to detect malicious network activity and respond to threats accordingly. 

During the week I also attended an online Splunk4Rookies workshop hosted by some Splunk Solution's Engineers. We were given access to our own instance of Splunk Enterprise so this was a fantastic opportunity to get some hands on experience with the software. The aim of the workshop was to briefly show some of the capablities of Splunk and practice using SPL to search through and manipulate the data. I found the ability to quickly and efficiently draw pertient data from the dataset provided was exceptionally useful and highlighted how important SIEM tools can be for incident response. Upon finishing the session I had set up my first ever dashboard for "Security Operations" that gave me a nice visual display of some basic indicators of malicious activity.

This week gave me a fascinating insight into the work of a SOC analyst and the tools that we could expect to use in such a position.
