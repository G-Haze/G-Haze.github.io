## IoC Skills Bootcamp Week 3 - Security Operations and Incident Response

The purpose of this week was to introduce us to the work of a Security Operations Center (SOC) and the use of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. Often referred to as the “blue team”, the SOC is responsible for defending our systems and our networks. They will proactively monitor activity, triage alerts against published threat reports, and will provide incident response in the case of a breach. Their role requires them to understand large volumes of activity data and contextualise these against the infrastructure they are protecting.

We were given a TryHackMe room to complete on [Splunk](https://tryhackme.com/room/bpsplunk), one of the most commonly used SIEM tools in the industry. In the scenario we had to identify an Advanced Persistent Threat within our network who had defaced our external website.

Splunk Enterprise Security is a powerful SIEM tool that has a wide range of applications across various industries. It is capable of aggregating machine data from multiple streams and feeding this into a graphical user interface for interpretation. The Splunk software makes the gathered data much easier to analyse and visualise through the use of Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) and the creation of customisable dashboards. It is commonly used in Security Operations Centres (SOCs) for identifying incident response.

I also attended an online Splunk4Rookies workshop at UWE presented by a couple of Solution's Engineers from Splunk Inc. We were given access to our own instance of Splunk Enterprise so this was another fantastic chance to get some practice at using Splunk. The instance used the same BoSS of the SOC dataset.

We were given a hands on experience with Splunk, a leading tool in the SIEM workspace. We used datasets from the BoSS of the SoC (add link here) that provided real world scenarios for us to practice with. This gave us an insight into the work of a SoC analyst and the tools that we could expect to use in such a position.

I found the ability to quickly and efficiently draw pertient data from the dataset provided was exceptionally useful and show
