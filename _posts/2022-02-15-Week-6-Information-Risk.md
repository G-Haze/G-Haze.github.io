## IoC Skills Bootcamp Week 6 - Information Risk

Information Security Principles

Fundamental to the practice of Cyber Security is the concept of the CIA Triad. This combines three key principles of data security; Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability, that act as a foundation for developing systems and policies to protect data.

Confidentiality - keeping data secure and only available to authorised individuals, entities or processes
Integrity - keeping data clean and accurate
Availability - keeping data accessible and usable upon demand by an authorised individual or entity

Impact

Cyber security practitioners must have an awareness of information risk management as it is pivotal to the role of protecting data, information and computer systems. The threats to an entity or system, its vulnerabilities and the nature of its assets all contribute to its overall risk and should be assessed based on likelihood and severity. With this information a plan can be put in place to mitigate attacks that may impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.

ISO 27001

Formally known as ISO/IEC 27001:2005, ISO 27001 is the international standard for managing information security published by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). It provides a specification for an information security management system (ISMS). An ISMS is a framework of policies and procedures that includes all legal, physical and technical controls involved in an organisation's information risk management processes.
