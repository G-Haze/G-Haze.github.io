## IoC Skills Bootcamp Week 6 - Information Risk

Cyber security practitioners should have an awareness of information risk management - it is fundamental to the role of protecting data, information, and computer systems. You should think about the threats, vulnerabilities and assets that contribute to give an overall risk, and how that can be assessed based on likelihood and severity. You should consider how to mitigate attacks that may impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.

ISO 27001

Formally known as ISO/IEC 27001:2005, ISO 27001 is the international standard for managing information security published by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). It provides a specification for an information security management system (ISMS). An ISMS is a framework of policies and procedures that includes all legal, physical and technical controls involved in an organisation's information risk management processes.
