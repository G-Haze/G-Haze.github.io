## IoC Skills Bootcamp Week 6 - Information Risk

Information Security Principles

Fundamental to the practice of Cyber Security is the concept of the CIA Triad. This combines three key principles of data security; Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability, that act as a foundation for developing systems and policies to protect data.

Confidentiality - keeping data secure and only available to authorised individuals, entities or processes
Integrity - keeping data clean and accurate
Availability - keeping data accessible and usable upon demand by an authorised individual or entity

It is important to understand the difference between vulnerabilities and threats and how these relate to risk. 

A threat is any event that has the potential to cause harm to a system or organisation. There are natural threats, which are caused by Mother Nature such as flooding or tornadoes. Intentional threats where someone acts with the intent to cause harm, for example, a disgruntled employee who aims to get back at the company which fired him. And lastly, unintentional threats such as losing a memory stick with records on it or accidently sending data to the wrong recipient by mistake.

Whereas a vulnerability is a weakness in a security system or asset that leaves it susceptible to exploitation by an attacker _(or threat)_. These could be general vulnerabilities like the building and facilities not having sufficient security measures allowing unauthorised access to it or information-specific such as unsecured computers and servers, personal devices and operating system vulnerabilities that have not been patched. 

We can refer to risk as the potential that a given threat will exploit a vulnerability and cause harm to the system or organisation in question.

Cyber security practitioners must have an awareness of information risk management as it is pivotal to the role of protecting data, information and computer systems. The threats to an entity or system, its vulnerabilities and the nature of its assets all contribute to its overall risk and they should be assessed based on likelihood and severity. With this information a plan can be put in place to mitigate attacks that may impact on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.

ISO 27001

Formally known as ISO/IEC 27001:2005, ISO 27001 is the international standard for managing information security published by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). It provides a specification for an information security management system (ISMS). An ISMS is a framework of policies and procedures that includes all legal, physical and technical controls involved in an organisation's information risk management processes.
