## IoC Skills Bootcamp Week 6 - Information Risk

### Information Security Principles

Fundamental to the practice of cyber security is the concept of the CIA Triad. This combines three key principles of data security; confidentiality, integrity and availability, that act as a foundation for developing systems and policies to protect data.

- Confidentiality: keeping data secure and only available to authorised individuals, entities or processes
- Integrity: keeping data clean and accurate
- Availability: keeping data accessible and usable upon demand by an authorised individual or entity

It is important to understand the difference between vulnerabilities and threats and how these translate into risk. 

A **threat** is any event that has the potential to cause harm to a system or organisation. There are natural threats, which are caused by Mother Nature such as flooding or tornadoes. Intentional threats where someone acts with the intent to cause harm, for example, a disgruntled employee who aims to get back at the company which fired him. And lastly, unintentional threats such as losing a memory stick with records on it or accidently sending data to the wrong recipient by mistake.

Whereas a **vulnerability** is a weakness in a security system or asset that leaves it susceptible to exploitation by an attacker _(or threat)_. These could be general vulnerabilities like the building and facilities not having sufficient security measures allowing unauthorised access to it or information-specific such as unsecured computers and servers, personal devices and operating system vulnerabilities that have not been patched. 

**Threat x Vulnerability = Risk**

We can therefore refer to **risk** as the potential that a given threat will exploit a vulnerability and cause harm to the system or organisation in question.

### ISO 27001

Formally known as ISO/IEC 27001:2005, ISO 27001 is the international standard for managing information security published by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). It provides a specification for an information security management system (ISMS). An ISMS is a framework of policies and procedures that includes all legal, physical and technical controls involved in an organisation's information risk management processes.

ISO 27001 is split into two sections. The first section is made up of 11 clauses which are numbered 0 to 10. Clauses 0 to 4 give an introduction to the standard and define some key terms used throughout. Clauses 4 to 10 outline the auditable requirements that an organisation must meet to be compliant with the standard. 

Following on from this, the second section (Annex A) details examples of controls that support the clauses and requirements outlined in the first section. It is not mandatory to put in place every control listed however, an organisation should select the applicable controls based 
their risk assessment. 

In order to gain ISO 27001 certification an organisation must show that they have created a compliant ISMS that they are able to maintain, review and continually improve. It must then be examined by an accredited certification body who will conduct a two stage audit. The first stage looks at the documentation of the ISMS policy while the second stage looks at how it works in practice. 

Gaining certification demonstrates that the company and its senior management is serious about their information security practices. This gives assurance to their customers as it shows they are following applicable laws and regulations and have a suitable process for identify, assessing and managing organisational risk, verified by a third party. This will enhance their organisation's reputation which in turn may result in new business opportunities. 

There are also other country specific information security standards. In the UK we have the National Cyber Security Centre's (NCSC) **Cyber Essentials** and **Cyber Essentials Plus**. The Cyber Essentials certification comprises of a self-assessment against five basic security controls; Firewalls, Secure configuration, User access control, Malware protection and Patch management, which is then reviewed by a qualified assessor. It is designed so that if all the criteria are adequately met the business should have sufficient defenses in place to protect themselves from the majority of common cyber attacks. Cyber Essentials Plus goes a step further by having a qualified assessor examine and conduct a technical audit of the same five controls instead of the self-assessment.

### Conclusion

Cyber security practitioners must have an awareness of information risk management as it is pivotal to the role of protecting data, information and computer systems. The threats to an entity or system, its vulnerabilities and the nature of its assets all contribute to its overall risk and they should be assessed based on likelihood and severity. With this information a plan can be put in place to mitigate attacks that may impact on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.
