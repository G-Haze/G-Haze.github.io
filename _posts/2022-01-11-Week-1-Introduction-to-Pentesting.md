The main purpose was to get us thinking about the process of a pentration test and get some experience with some of the common tools that can be used. 

Enumeration is the process of gathering information on a target in order to find potential attack vectors and aid in exploitation. Enumeration can be used to gather usernames, passwords, network information, hostnames, application data, services, or any other information that may be valuable to an attacker.

I began by scanning the target machine to gather some information. Using `nmap` we are able to identify what ports are currently open. Network mapper (nmap) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. It is able to to find out what hosts are available on the network, the services those hosts are offering, the operating systems (and OS versions) they are running and much more. 

After identifying that port 80 was open we checked to see whether there was a web page that could be viewed in our browser. The page didn't give us much information to go off but using the Web Developer Tools I noticed some comments in the html that implied there were other sections on the website.

This is where I was introduced to `DIRB` and `DirBuster` which are web content enumeration tools. They use a wordlist to test for hidden files/libraries that exist on a web server and can possibly be accessed if requested directly. These are examples of brute-force attacks that creates a lot of noise and they would show up fast in the logs. However, they were suitable to use in this test scenario and they were able to find one listable directory `/development`.

`enum4linux` is a tool for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems. It is capable of discovering domain and group membership, users, shares on a device (drives and folders) as well as the operating system and password policies of the target machine. In the pentesting scenario the scan showed me that there were two user accounts on the machine. 

With one of these usernames and a well known network login cracker, **Hydra**, I was able to crack their password and then `ssh` onto the target machine. 

I used John the Ripper to crack a private hash key that was found on the machine. This involved copying the file to my machine, running
