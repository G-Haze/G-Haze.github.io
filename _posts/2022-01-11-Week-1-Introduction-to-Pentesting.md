## IoC Skills Bootcamp Week 1 - Introduction to Pentesting

Our first task was to complete the "Basic Pentesting" room on tryhackme. The main purpose was to get us thinking about the process of a pentration test and get some experience with some of the common tools that can be used. 

Enumeration is the process of gathering information on a target in order to find potential attack vectors and aid in exploitation. Enumeration can be used to gather usernames, passwords, network information, hostnames, application data, services, or any other information that may be valuable to an attacker.

To find a point of entry we must first gather information to understand what we are attacking. *Network mapper* (nmap) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. Using `nmap` and its many switches we are able to identify what hosts are available on the network, the services those hosts are offering, the operating systems (and OS versions) they are running and much more. Sometimes it can be useful to save the output of the scans requiring them to be run only once, reducing network traffic and therefore chance of detection.

After identifying that port 80 was open, I checked to see whether there was a web page that could be viewed in our browser. The page didn't give much information to work with but using the Web Developer Tools I noticed some comments in the html that implied there were other sections on the website.

This is where I was introduced to **DIRB** and **DirBuster** which are web content enumeration tools. They use a wordlist to test for hidden files/libraries that exist on a web server that can possibly be accessed if requested directly. These are examples of brute-force attacks that create a lot of noise and therefore would show up fast in the logs. However, they were suitable to use in this test scenario and were both able to find one listable directory `/development`.

Inside this directory was a note stating that one user was using weak password credentials as their hash was able to be cracked "really easily" by their supervisor. It mentioned /etc/shadow confirming it was a linux box so we could try **enum4linux** to enumerate the system for more information. This tool is capable of discovering domain and group membership, users, shares on a device (drives and folders) as well as the operating system and password policies of the target machine. In the pentesting scenario the scan showed that there were two user accounts on the machine. 

Using one of the usernames and a well known network login cracker, **Hydra**, it wasn't long until I had cracked their password and was able to use it to `ssh` onto the machine. 

The final tool I used in the tutorial was **John the Ripper** as he was needed to crack a private hash key that was found on the machine. The process involved copying the file to my virtual machine and then running the python script `ssh2John.py` to get it into a suitable hash format for John to accept. While trying to do this it threw up an error saying `It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.` so I had to fix the permissions using `chmod`. After that slight hiccup John got to work on the standard wordlist `rockyou.txt` and was able to find a match. 

## Conclusion

It was a wonderful first experience into the mindset and practical side of pentetration testing. It was also great to get some hands on experience with a range of tools for different applications. I was able to scan the system, find hidden content, find the potential weaknesses and exploit them. I understand that in real scenarios things may not have been as easy or obvious but the theory and tools remain the same.
