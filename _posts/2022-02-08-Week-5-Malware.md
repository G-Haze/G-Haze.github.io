## IoC Skills Bootcamp Week 5 - Malware

### What is Malware Analysis?

Malware analysis is the process of determining the function, origin and potential impact of a piece of malware (malicious software). When conducting malware analysis for incidence response it is important to consider the following:
- Point of Entry (PoE). How the file got onto the machine. Was it through opening an email attachment, inserting a USB or visiting a compromised website?
- Indicators that malware has been executed on the machine. Are there any files, processes or communication attempts that seem out of the ordinary?
- What does the malware do? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Does it encrypt files or install a backdoor / Remote Access Tool (RAT)?
- How further infection can be detected and prevented.

Malware attacks can be generally classified into two types: **Targeted** and **Mass Campaign**. 
A targeted attack is one where the malware has been created for a specific purpose against a specific target. An example of this could be the Stuxnet malware which was configured to only run on the targetted programmable logic controllers inside Natanz nuclear facility.
This differs from a Mass Campaign attack whose purpose is to infect as many devices as possible and perform it's function regardless of target. The WannaCry ransomware cryptoworm in May 2017 used the EternalBlue exploit and the DoublePulsar tool to infect over 230,000 Windows PCs across 150 countries in a single day.

Sometimes it can be fairly simple to decide if a piece of code is "malicious" from performing Static Analysis. This involves analysing the sample in the state it presents itself without executing the code.

Employing the use of techniques such as signature analysis via checksums means quick, efficient (albeit extremely brief) and safe analysis of malware.
Reverse engineering.

On the other hand, Dynamic Analysis is where we execute the code in a safe environment (usually a virtual machine) in order to see what happens.
