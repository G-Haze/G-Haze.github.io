## Week 5 - Malware

### What is Malware Analysis?

Malware analysis is the process of determining the function, origin and potential impact of a piece of malware (malicious software). When conducting malware analysis for incidence response it is important to consider the following:
- Point of Entry (PoE). How the file got onto the machine. Was it through opening an email attachment, inserting a USB or visiting a compromised website?
- Indicators that malware has been executed on the machine. Are there any files, processes or communication attempts that seem out of the ordinary?
- What does the malware do? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Does it encrypt files or install a backdoor / Remote Access Tool (RAT)?
- How further infection can be detected and prevented.

Malware attacks can be generally classified into two types: **Targeted** and **Mass Campaign**. 
A targeted attack is one where the malware has been created for a specific purpose against a specific target. An example of this method could the DarkHotel malware which is designed to steal information from political officials and global C-level executives.
This differs from a Mass Campaign attack whose purpose is to infect as many devices as possible and perform it's function regardless of target. The WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017

###### Identifying if a Malware Attack has Happened
The ultimate process of a malware attack can be broken down into a few broad steps:

Delivery
This could be of many methods, to name a few: USB (Stuxnet!), PDF attachments through "Phising" campaigns or vulnerability enumeration.

Execution
Here's the main part of how we classify Malware. What does it actually do? If it encrypts files - it's Ransomware! If it records information like keystrokes or displays adware - we can classify it as Spyware.
We only understand this stage through analysing the sample, which is why analysis is important - and is what we'll be covering.

Maintaining persistence (not always the case!)
It wouldn't make much sense for Malware authors to go through all the trouble of developing a piece of code that is capable of execution - just for it to execute and that's it...Gone. Unless you have a very specific agenda (Cerber).
I have submitted an extensive report on this specific Malware, amongst others for a University Module on Malware Analysis...however I will wait for it to be marked before sharing. 
Imagine a keylogger has been installed, but you then restart your Computer 30 seconds later. Unless you've entered a lot of sensitive information in 30 seconds - that'll be of no use to the author.
This stage is largely why Malware is so "noisy", Malware employs many techniques, of which we'll be covering in-depth much later on. Essentially, this stage is just to make sure that the "execution" is worth its while.

Propagation (not always!)
Hey...If you can infect one device, why not infect more whilst you're at it? Again, this is another reason why Malware can be so noticeable. Host discovery generates a lot of network traffic, we'll come to this later.

## Analyising Malware

Static Analysis
Reverse engineering.

Dynamic Analysis
Running the file usually in a virtual machine in order to see what happens.
